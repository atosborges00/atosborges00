-  Hi, I’m Atos Borges
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all kinds of stuff. I'm specialized in Machine Learning and Data Science, but right now I'm learning new stuff about web development, mainly backend in Ruby! Awesome right?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on companies, research, cool projects, open source, and anything that tickles that part of my brain.
- 📫 You can reach me by my e-mail: atosborges00@gmail.com

- Oh! You can use any of my public codes, but please don't use them to cause any harm anywhere or I'll be sad :(
